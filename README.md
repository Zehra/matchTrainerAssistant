# Match Trainer Assistant

A remake of the plug-in by An SQUERRIL requested by hj; this plugin introduces convenience commands for players practicing on servers.

I never used the original plug-in so I'm going off what I was told. If you'd like to make a feature request, [start an issue](https://github.com/allejo/matchTrainerAssistant/issues); don't PM me or tell me, I will forget. Issues will also allow for other developers to contribute the feature if I don't have the time.
